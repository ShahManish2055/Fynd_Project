Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, and it uses a non-blocking I/O model with an event-driven architecture to handle concurrency.At the heart of this architecture is the event loop. The event loop is a loop that continuously checks for new events to handle, such as incoming requests or completed I/O operations. When an event occurs, it is added to the event loop's queue, which is then processed by the event loop in a non-blocking manner.The event loop starts by processing the first event in the event queue. If there are no events in the queue, it waits for events to be added.When an event is processed, it is handled by the appropriate event handler, which is a callback function that was registered to handle that type of event.While the event handler is executing, the event loop continues to process other events in the queue.When an event handler completes, it may generate new events that are added to the event queue. These new events will be processed by the event loop in the same way as any other events.This process continues indefinitely until the Node.js application is terminated.
